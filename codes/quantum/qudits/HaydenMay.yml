We all know that the quantum information cannot be cloned. However, one could
use quantum error correction schemes to store the quantum information
in a larger domain of space, or one can store quantum information
in long-range correlations of a many-body system. Furthermore, it is (in principle)
very easy to clone the quantum information through time by merely waiting.
Having said that, the paper fully characterizes what regions of spacetime
can all hold the same quantum information by making use of (an unusual) stabilizer code, called CWS, and the concept of \textit{summonding}, which had been
studeid before in the context of relativistic quantum theory by Kent.\\
We can think of the summonding task by considering \(n\) pair of points in the spacetime,
which are referred to as \textit{call-reveal} points, and are denoted by \( (y_i,z_i)_{i=0}^{n-1} \).
The rule is that only one of the \textit{call points} receive a request, say \(y_j\),
and moreover, the particle should be measured at the corresponding \textit{reveal point} \(z_j\).
If the summoning is possible (with some predetermined strategy), then it is the case that
the quantum information could be propagated through the region of spacetime determined by the call-reveal points.\\
Authors make use of quantum error correction schemes to prove that the fundumental laws of relativity and quantum information,
which are causality and no-cloning, are the only conditions that determine the feasibility of a summoning task (obviously these conditions are necessary,
but the non-trivial part is the sufficiency; this is where quantum error correction techniques are needed).'

protection: 'Protects again certain erasure errors (which depend on the location of call-reveal points in spacetime, and is designed to to make summonding possible).'
