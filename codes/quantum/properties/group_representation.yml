code_id: group_representation

name: 'Group-representation code'
introduced: '\cite{arXiv:2005.10910,arxiv:2305.07023,arxiv:2306.11621}'

description: |
  Code whose projection is onto an irreducible representation of a subgroup \(G\) of a group of canonical or distinguished unitary operations, e.g., transversal gates in the case of block quantum codes, Gaussian operations in the case of bosonic codes, or \(SU(2)\) operations in the case of single-spin codes.

protection: |
  Error correction ability is not guaranteed, but can be searched in the multiplicity space of the irrep in case there is more than one copy present.

  encoders:
    - 'General encoding map \cite[Lemma 1]{arxiv:2306.11621}.'
  general_gates:
    - 'By definition, a group \(G\) of gates can be realized on the code using the unitary operations used to define the code.'

      detail: 'Group-representation code projections are onto an irrep of a subgroup of canonical or distinguished unitary operations on a Hilbert space.
      Removing the restriction to distinguished operations and allowing all operations, every code projection on an \(N\)-dim Hilbert space can be expressed as a projection onto the irrep formed by the code-preserving subgroup of \(U(N)\).
      The same idea holds when \(N\) is taken to infinity.'

#     detail: 'There exist group-representation codes that are quantum spherical codes with non-uniform coefficients; such codes, by definition, admit a desired group of gates via Gaussian rotations \cite{arxiv:2306.11621}.'
