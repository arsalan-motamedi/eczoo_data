description: |
  A level-\(\nu\) quantum divisible code is a CSS code whose \(X\)-type stabilizers form a \(\nu\)-even linear binary code in the symplectic representation and which admits a transversal gate at the \(\nu\)th level of the \term{Clifford hierarchy}.
  A CSS code is \textit{doubly-even} (\textit{triply-even}) if all \(X\)-type stabilizer generators have weight divisible by four (eight), i.e., if they form a doubly-even (triply-even) linear binary code.
  Doubly-even codes can yield a transversal \(S\) gate, while triply-even codes yield a transversal \(T\) gate for odd \(n\) \cite{arxiv:1509.03239}.

  More formally \cite{arxiv:2109.13481,arXiv:2204.13176}, a quantum divisible code is a CSS code defined from two linear binary codes \(C_{1,2}\) such that all weights in \(C_2\) share a common divisor \(\Delta > 1\), and all weights in each coset of \(C_2\) in \(C_1\) are congruent to \(\Delta\).

  For example \cite{arXiv:2204.13176}, if \(C_2\) is the first-order Reed-Muller code, and \(C_1/ C_2\) consists of quadratic forms with a bounded rank, then \([[n = 2m − 1, 1 \leq k \leq 1 + \sum_{i=1}^{m-4}(m − i), d = 3]]\) is a family of quantum divisible codes.

  transversal_gates: |
      Doubly-even codes can yield a transversal \(S\) gate, while triply-even codes yield a transversal \(T\) gate for odd \(n\) \cite{arxiv:1509.03239}.
      More generally, if the \(X\)-type stabilizers of a CSS code form an \(\nu\)-even classical code, and if all \(X\)-type logicals are \((\nu-1)\)-even, then the code admit a diagonal transversal gate in the \(\nu\)th level of the \term{Clifford hierarchy} \cite[Prop. 8]{arxiv:1906.11394}.
      Necessary and sufficient conditions for a CSS code to yield such a gate have been formulated \cite[Thm. 9]{arxiv:2109.13481}\cite[Thm. 5]{arxiv:2204.13176}.


  general_gates:
    - 'The \([[2m − 1, 1 \leq k \leq 1 + \sum_{i=1}^{m-4}(m − i), 3]]\) quantum divisible code family can serve as outer codes of either the five-qubit \([[5,1,3]]\) or Steane \([[7,1,3]]\) code to realize a \(T\) gate on the inner code.
    For example, when \(m=5\) (\(m=6\)), the resulting \([[31,5,3]]\) (\([[63,7,3]]\)) code yields the \(T\) gate on the inner five-qubit (Steane) code.'

  fault_tolerance:
    - 'The \(T\) gate realized by concatenating members of the \([[2m − 1, 1 \leq k \leq 1 + \sum_{i=1}^{m-4}(m − i), 3]]\) quantum divisible code family with either the five-qubit \([[5,1,3]]\) or Steane \([[7,1,3]]\) code is fault-tolerant and does not require magic-state distillation \cite{arXiv:2204.13176}.
    The gate is performed on the inner five-qubit/Steane code and does require encoding and decoding algorithms to pass between the inner and outer codes.'
