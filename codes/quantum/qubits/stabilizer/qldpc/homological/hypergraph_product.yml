name: 'Hypergraph product (HGP) code'

description: |
  A member of a family of CSS codes whose stabilizer generator matrix is obtained from a hypergraph product of two classical linear codes.
  Codes from hypergraph products in higher dimension are called \textit{higher-dimensional HGP codes} \cite{arxiv:1810.01519}.

  The \([[n,k,d]]\) CSS code's construction is based on two binary linear \textit{seed} codes, \(i\in\{1,2\}\) \(C_i\) with parameters \([n_i, k_i, d_i]\) defined as the kernel of \(r_i \times n_i\) check matrices \(H_i\) of rank \(n_i - k_i\).
  The hypergraph product yields two classical codes \(C_{X,Z}\) with parity-check matrices
  \begin{align}
    H_{X}&=\begin{pmatrix}H_{1}\otimes I_{n_{2}} & \,\,I_{r_{1}}\otimes H_{2}^{T}\end{pmatrix}\\
    H_{Z}&=\begin{pmatrix}I_{n_{1}}\otimes H_{2} & \,\,H_{1}^{T}\otimes I_{r_{2}}\end{pmatrix}~,
  \end{align}
  where \(I_m\) is the \(m\)-dimensional identity matrix.
  These two codes then yield a hypergraph product code via the CSS construction.

# Could be expanded to include Tanner graphs
# Defn of CSS has been changed to accomodate this... In contrast to the original CSS construction there are no restrictions on the form of \(C_1\) and \(C_2\).'

protection: 'If \([n_i, k_i, d_i]\) (\([r_i, k^T_i, d^T_i]\)) are the parameters of the codes \(\mathrm{ker}H_i\) (\(\mathrm{ker}H_i^T\), taking (\(d=\infty\) if \(k=0\)), the hypergraph product has parameters \([[n_1 n_2 + r_1 r_2, k_1 k_2 + k_1^T k_2^T, \min(d_1, d_2, d_1^T, d_2^T)]]\)'
